# "Experimental Research in Legislative Studies" Short Course

This page holds materials for a one-day course on "Experimental Research in Legislative Studies" that I will be teaching at the ECPR Summer School on Parliaments at Humboldt University Berlin August 18, 2017.

## Overview

This course will use published and unpublished examples of experimental research on legislatures to examine possibilities and challenges in implementing experimental research on elite populations. By the end of the course, students should be able to:

 1. Explain how to analyze experiments quantitatively.
 2. Explain how to design experiments that speak to relevant research questions and theories.
 3. Evaluate the uses and limitations of three common legislative experimental paradigms: survey experiments, field experiments, and simulations.
 4. Identify practical issues that arise in the implementation of experiments and evaluate how to anticipate and respond to them.

The course will provide a general introduction to causal inference in experiments, then evaluate three common paradigms for experimental research on legislatures: survey experiments, field (and quasi-)experiments, and simulations. All discussions will be based upon 

An outline of the course is given below. 

## First Session (Morning)

The first session will provide an overview of the course, discuss the history of experiments, and provide a conceptual and notational framework for design, analyzing, and discussing experiments.

 - Gerber and Green
 - Holland, P. W. 1986. "Statistics and Causal Inference." *Journal of the American Statistical Association* 81: 945-960.

 - Materials from Anchoring Experiment Activity
   - [Data](activities/activity01.tsv) (tab-separated values)
   - [R script](activities/activity01.R)
   - [Stata .do file](activities/activity01.do)

## Second Session (Morning)

The second session will discuss field experiments and quasi-experiments on parliaments and legislatures.

Experiments orchestrated by researchers:

 - Broockman (2013) - "Black Politicians Are More Intrinsically Motivated to Advance Blacks' Interests: A Field Experiment Manipulating Political Incentives"
 - Neblo, Esterling, Kennedy, Lazer, Sokhey (2010) - "Who Wants To Deliberateâ€”And Why?"
 - Butler, Nickerson (2011) - "Can Learning Constituency Opinion Affect How Legislators Vote? Results from a Field Experiment"
 
Experiments *not* orchestrated by researchers:

 - Cirone, van Coppenolle (2017) - "Cabinets, Committees and Careers: A Natural Experiment in 19th Century France"
 - Broockman, Butler (2015) - "Do Better Committee Assignments Meaningfully Benefit Legislators? Evidence from a Randomized Experiment in the Arkansas State Legislature"
 - Loewen, Koop, Settle, Fowler (2014) - "A Natural Experiment in Proposal Powerand Electoral Success"
 - Chattopadhyay, Duflo (2004) - "Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India"
 
## Third Session (Afternoon)

The third session will discuss surveys (interview-based) experiments.

 - Renshon, Yarhi-Milo, and Kertzer (2016) - "Democratic Leaders, Crises and War: Paired Experiments on the Israeli Knesset and Public"
 - Butler, Dynes (2016) - "How Politicians Discount the Opinions of Constituents with Whom They Disagree"
 - Butler, Powell (2014) - "Understanding the Party Brand: Experimental Evidence on the Role of Valence"
 - Walgrave, Sevenans, Van Camp, Loewen (2017) - "What Draws Politicians' Attention? An Experimental Study of Issue Framing and its Effect on Individual Political Elites"
 - Bayram (2017) - "Due Deference: Cosmopolitan Social Identity and the Psychology of Legal Obligation in International Politics"

## Fourth Session (Afternoon)

The fourth and final session will discuss parliamentary simulations and game theoretic experiments, with a focus on voting and coalition formation.

 - McKelvey, Ordeshook (JOP, 1984) - "An Experimental Study of the Effects of Procedural Rules on Committee Behavior"
 - Wilson (1986) - "Forward and Backward Agenda Procedures: Committee Experiments on Structurally Induced Equilibrium"
