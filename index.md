# "Experimental Research in Legislative Studies" Short Course

This page holds materials for a one-day course on "Experimental Research in Legislative Studies" that I will be teaching at the ECPR Summer School on Parliaments at Humboldt University Berlin August 18, 2017.

## Overview

This course will use published and unpublished examples of experimental research on legislatures to examine possibilities and challenges in implementing experimental research on elite populations. By the end of the course, students should be able to:

 1. Explain how to analyze experiments quantitatively.
 2. Explain how to design experiments that speak to relevant research questions and theories.
 3. Evaluate the uses and limitations of three common legislative experimental paradigms: survey experiments, field experiments, and simulations.
 4. Identify practical issues that arise in the implementation of experiments and evaluate how to anticipate and respond to them.

The course will provide a general introduction to causal inference in experiments, then evaluate three common paradigms for experimental research on legislatures: survey experiments, field (and quasi-)experiments, and simulations. All discussions will be based upon published example articles.

For background reading, students may be interested in the following review articles:

 - Druckman, Leeper, Mullinix (2011) - "The Experimental Study of Legislative Behaviour"
 - Grose (2014) - "Field Experimental Work on Political Institutions"

An outline of the course is given below, along with required and suggested reading for each session. [All readings are available here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwxjj0JIn0KoZnhZSlZhSG5ranc?usp=sharing).

## First Session (Morning)

The first session will provide an overview of the course, discuss the history of experiments, and provide a conceptual and notational framework for designing, analyzing, and discussing experiments.

   - [R script](activities/activity01.R)
   - [Stata .do file](activities/activity01.do)

## Second Session (Morning)

The second session will discuss the three dominant paradigms of experiments in legislative contexts: field experiments and quasi-experiments, survey experiments, and simulation studies, with reference to published and unpublished examples.
