\frametitle{Establishing Relationship}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em

\item Simply find value of $Corr(X,Y)$
\item In causal inference we often talk about correlations in terms of \textit{differences}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Difference in values of $Y$ across values of $X$
	\item The presence of a difference indicates a correlation

\frametitle{Addressing Confounding}

In observational studies, we address confounding by:

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep1em
\item<2-> Correlating a ``putative'' cause ($X$) and an outcome ($Y$)
\item<3-> Identifying all possible confounds (\textbf{Z})
\item<4-> ``Conditioning'' on all confounds

	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Temporal Precedence}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Even if an observational design identifies a relationship and credibly addresses sources of confounding, it still may not be a credible causal inference

\item<2-> ``Reverse causality'' is vague, referring to:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Ambiguity about causal ordering, or
	\item Sequentially reinforcing causality between $X$ and $Y$
	\end{itemize}

\item<3-> Causation is strictly forward moving in time

\item<4-> $X$ must precede $Y$ in time for $X$ to cause $Y$

	\begin{itemize}
	\item $X$ can be \textit{measured} after $Y$ as long as it comes before it

\frametitle{Three Major Paradigms}

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep1em
\item Field Experiments

	\begin{itemize}\small
	\item Ex. Broockman (2013) -- ``Black Politicians Are More Intrinsically Motivated to Advance Blacks' Interests''
	\end{itemize}

\item Survey Experiments

	\begin{itemize}\small
	\item Ex. Renshon, Yarhi-Milo, and Kertzer (2016) -- ``Democratic Leaders, Crises and War: Paired Experiments on the Israeli Knesset and Public''

\item Simulations

	\item Ex. Frechette, Kagel, Lehrer (2003) -- ``Bargaining in Legislatures: An Experimental Investigation of Open versus Closed Amendment Rules''
	\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

}


\frame{

\frametitle{Paradigm 1: Field Experiments}

\small

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Basic idea: randomly expose legislators \textit{in situ} to some experience and measure an outcome that might be affected by it

\item Two ``flavours''

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Orchestrated by the researcher(s)
	\item ``Natural'' experiments not orchestrated by the researcher(s)
	\end{enumerate}

\item Tend to be simple in terms of design due to practical difficulty of exposing legislators' to treatment and measuring outcomes

\item ``Natural'' experiments are limited by randomized institutions being rare (e.g., committee assignments, office locations, proposal rights/order, etc.)
\end{itemize}

}


\frame{

\frametitle{Paradigm 1: Field Experiments}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em

\item Example of Flavour A

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Broockman (2013)
	\item Treatment: Form of contact from a prospective constituent
	\item Outcome: Whether a response is received
	\item Effect: Difference in response rates by treatment
	\end{itemize}

\item Example of Flavour B

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Kellermann, Shepsle (2009)
	\item Treatment: Freshmen legislators are randomly ordered in determining committee assignments
	\item Outcome: Various metrics of leadership and legislative activity
	\item Effect: Difference in those outcomes between higher- and lower-ranked legislators
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
}

\frame{

\frametitle{Paradigm 2: Survey experiments}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item Basic idea: conduct interviews with legislators (in-person or through another mode), where features of questionnaire are randomized

\item Recruiting legislators into interviews tends to be extremely difficult, thus:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Almost unavoidably underpowered 
	
	\item Can only study legislators who agree to participate

	\item Necessarily simplistic designs with treatment and outcome measured in a single interview\footnote{Can be generalized to allow field treatments with survey measures, or survey treatments with field measures}
	
	\item Survey experiments on legislators tend to be rare
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

}

\frame{

\frametitle{{\normalsize Paradigm 2: Survey Experiments}}

\small

Example:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em

\item Butler and Dynes (2016)

\item Treatment: State legislators completing a survey read a hypothetical constituent letter with varying stated opinions

\item Outcome: Measures of perceptions of constituent characteristics (e.g., knowledge)

\item Effect: Difference in perceptions b/w constituents with similar/dissimilar views to legislator

\end{itemize}
}


\frame{

\frametitle{Paradigm 3: Simulations}

\small

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item Basic idea: Derive theoretical expectations about legislative behavior and test those predictions in a \textit{stylized} legislative context using non-legislators as participants

\item These are historically much more common than paradigms 1 or 2

\item Unique considerations:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Tend to be based in formal theories of legislatures
	\item Sample sizes limited by resources
	\item Historically in labs, but increasingly common online
	\item Tend to lack face validity given context and participants
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

}


\frame{

\frametitle{Paradigm 3: Simulations}

Example:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em

\item Wilson (1986)

\item Treatment: ``Legislators'' vote under open or closed amendment rules

\item Outcome: The final ``policy'' adopted by the ``legislature''

\item Effect: Difference in ``policy'' adopted by the legislature

\item Ethics

}


% Nonresponse and Noncompliance
\frame{
\frametitle{Nonresponse}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em

\item In survey experiments, nonresponse may introduce challenges:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Underpowered designs
	\item Response biases that affect generalizability
	\item Nonresponse may be due to treatment
	\item Nonresponse may be due to attrition
	\end{itemize}

\item The only way to avoid nonresponse is to try to incentivize response or minimize effort involved in a study

\item Real risk: more surveys might create common pool resource problems!
\end{itemize}

}


\frame{
\frametitle{Compliance}

\small

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Compliance is when individuals receive and accept the treatment to which they are assigned, as opposed to:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Receiving the wrong treatment (cross-over)
	\item Failing to receive any treatment 
	\end{itemize}
\item This causes problems for our analysis because factors other than randomization explain why individuals receive their treatment

\item Possible responses to noncompliance:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item ``As treated'' analysis
	\item ``Intention to treat'' analysis
	\item Estimate a LATE
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Analyzing Noncompliance}

\small

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item If noncompliance only occurs in one group, it is \textit{asymmetric} or \textit{one-sided}

\item We can ignore non-compliance and analyze the ``intention to treat'' effect, which will underestimate our effects because some people were not treated as assigned: $ITT = \overline{Y}_1 - \overline{Y}_0$

\item<2-> We can use ``instrumental variables'' to estimate the ``local average treatment effect'' (LATE) for those that complied with treatment: $LATE = \frac{ITT}{\% Compliant}$

\item<3-> If noncompliance is symmetric, analysis much more complicated.
\end{itemize}
}

\questions


% Spillover
\frame{

\frametitle{Spillover}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item A key assumption of experimental analysis is that units are \textit{independent}

\item This assumption may be implausible in legislatures because units are in regular communication and may ``share'' some of their treatment with others in the group

\item What can be done?

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Try to avoid it by design!
	\item Exclude individuals affected by spillovers, if observable
	\item More complicated procedures
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

}

% What can be randomized?
\frame{

\frametitle{What can be randomized?}

\small

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item In theory almost anything can be randomized, but not everything

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Intrinsic characteristics
	\item Institutional features (outside of simulations)
	\item Contextual factors
	\end{itemize}

\item Anything that is ``information-like'' can easily and obviously be randomized\footnote{Messages, contact, personal interactions, etc.}

\item If you want to study factors that are not information-like:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Look for ``natural'' experiments
	\item Run simulations
	\item Run field or survey experiments that attempt to modify the \textit{salience} of those factors
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

}


% Ethics
\frame{

\frametitle{Research Ethics}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item Researchers have obligations to attempt to:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item minimize risk to participants
	\item to maximize benefits to human knowledge
	\item to protect the privacy of personal data
	\item to fairly and objectively report their research
	\end{itemize}
\item<2-> These rules vary to some extent across contexts
\item<3-> But a major question is whether these ``standard'' ethical rules also apply to politicians. What do you think?

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item Experiments are mostly about design, not analysis

\item Experiments are underutilized in legislative contexts, in part because conducting them effectively is extremely difficult

\item This means that careful but often simple design can generate potentially powerful and novel insights into legislative behavior
